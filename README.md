# Event Driven Architecture

This is a challenge of the Event Driven Architecture course that I took at [FullCycle](https://fullcycle.com.br/) by [Wesley Willians](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesleywillians/).

Some microservices are part of this project, such as Wallet Core and Balances. Walet Core was originally rewritten by me from Golang to Nodejs.

The project basically consists of back-end and APIs.

The technologies used are:

- NodeJs - programming language
- Expressjs - web server
- Jest - tests
- MySQL - relational database
- MongoDB - non-relational database
- Docker - conteiners
- Docker Compose - container orchestration
- Apache Kafka - message broker
- Zookeeper - service discovery
